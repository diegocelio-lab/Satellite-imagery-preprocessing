# Satellite-imagery-preprocessing
This repository offers algorithms for the pre-processing and mosaicking of GeoTIFF satellite imagery: contrast enhancement algorithms (Simplest Colour Balance, LogLocal Colour Correction, and Multiscale Retinex), a colour harmonising algorithm (Midway Image Equalisation), and an optimal seamline computation algorithm.
